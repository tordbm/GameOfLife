# GameOfLife
This is a game of life implementation done in Haskell as part of an individual project in my Functional Programming class.

## How to run

After having GHCi installed one can run `stack runhaskell "Oblig2.hs"` to run the script.

From there, the game can be played based on the rules of a file by providing "r *filename*". It also has a way of defining rules as you go, but I canÂ´t remember how...

The "test.txt" file is just to demonstrate a scenario. It contains rules on the following form: 
<ul>
<li>boardsize</li>
<li>(how to survive as a cell and when a cell is born)</li>
<li>coordinates of cells in the starting game as row col row col etc</li>
</ul>

When the board is displayed, type "quit" to quit the script, "l *generations*"("l 5" for instance) to autorun for x number of *generations* and *ENTER* to skip generations.

Play with the rules in the file and figure out how it works!
